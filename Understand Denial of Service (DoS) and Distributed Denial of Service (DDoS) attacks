1. What is a Denial of Service (DoS) Attack?

A DoS attack is when an attacker intentionally sends too many requests or malformed traffic to a target system (website, server, API) to make it:

Slow

Unresponsive

Completely unavailable

👉 The goal is service disruption, not data theft.

Simple example:

Imagine 1 attacker keeps hitting a website with thousands of requests per second → the server becomes overloaded → real users can’t access it.

What is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack?

A DDoS attack is a DoS attack launched from multiple systems at the same time, often from a botnet.

A botnet = thousands or millions of infected computers (“bots”) controlled by a hacker (command & control server).

Example:

1 hacker controls 20,000 infected devices

Sends traffic simultaneously to the victim

Server crashes instantly

👉 DDoS = higher power, harder to stop.
