1. Understanding Malware: The Parent Category

Malware (Malicious Software) is any program intentionally designed to harm, exploit, or infiltrate computers or networks.

Types of Malicious Behaviors

Steal data

Damage files

Spy on users

Hijack the system

Control the system remotely

Spread across networks

Encrypt data for ransom

Everything else (virus, worm, trojan, spyware, rootkit, etc.) is a type of malware.

2. Viruses

A virus attaches itself to a legitimate file or program.

How it works

Injects its code into a host file (e.g., .exe, .doc).

When the host runs → virus executes.

It replicates by infecting more files.

It often damages or corrupts files.

Example scenario

You download a cracked game → it contains a virus → when you run it, it infects system files → computer slows, files get corrupted.

3. Worms

A worm is like a virus BUT does NOT need a host file and spreads automatically over networks.

How it works

Exploits vulnerabilities.

Spreads through network ports.

Can infect thousands of machines in minutes.

Example scenario

A worm enters a hospital network → it spreads from one PC to other PCs → shuts down systems → delays patient treatment.

Famous example

ILOVEYOU worm – infected 10 million computers in 2000.

Keyloggers

Keylogger = software or hardware that records whatever you type.

What it steals

Passwords

Credit card numbers

Chat messages

Emails

Real-life example

A keylogger is installed on a public computer → you log in to your bank → attacker gets your username + password.

Phishing

Phishing = tricking the user into giving sensitive information by sending fake emails or websites.

Example

Fake Gmail login page asking you to “verify account”.

Fake bank email: “Your account suspended”.

Techniques used

Social engineering

Spoofed domains e.g., paypaI.com (capital i instead of L)

Smishing

Smishing = phishing through SMS.

Example

You receive:
“Your bank account will be blocked. Verify now: http://fakebank.in”

Users click → enter OTP → attacker takes control.

Spoofing

Spoofing = pretending to be someone else.

Types

Email spoofing (“your CEO” emails for urgent payment)

Caller ID spoofing

IP spoofing

Website spoofing

Use-case

Attackers spoof Netflix support → ask you to enter payment details.

Spyware

Spyware steals user data silently.

What it spies

Browsing history

Keystrokes

Screenshots

Camera + microphone

Banking information

Scenario

You install a free wallpaper app → it secretly records everything you do.

9. Backdoors

A backdoor is a hidden entry point that bypasses normal authentication.

What it allows

Remote access

Uploading files

Executing commands

Modifying system

Where it exists

Malware-created backdoors

Developer-created backdoors

Misconfigured systems

Scenario

A hacker installs a backdoor → comes anytime → steals files or uploads ransomware.

10. Reverse Shells

A reverse shell is a powerful hacking technique.

How it works

Attacker waits on a listening port (attacker machine).

Victim machine initiates connection to attacker.

Attacker now controls victim command line.

Why it's dangerous?

Firewalls usually allow outbound traffic.

So attacker bypasses network restrictions.

11. Bind Shell

Opposite of reverse shell.

How it works

Attacker forces victim machine to open a port.

Attacker connects to that port.

Gains system shell access.

Difference

Reverse shell = victim → attacker

Bind shell = attacker → victim

12. Adware

Adware shows unwanted ads, popups, banners.

Impact

Slows system

Tracks browsing

Generates revenue for attackers

Scenario

You install a free app → your browser gets full of popups → ads redirect you to malware websites.

Trojans (Trojan Horse)

A trojan looks like a legitimate app but contains hidden malware.

How it spreads

Cracked apps

Fake installers

Game mods

Free software

What it delivers

Spyware

Ransomware

Backdoors

Botnet clients

Rootkits

Rootkits hide malware and provide root-level stealth access.

Capabilities

Hide processes

Hide files

Hide network connections

Bypass security tools

Disable antivirus

Scenario

A hacker installs a rootkit → you never see any malware → attacker silently uses your PC for years.

Types

Kernel-mode rootkit

User-mode rootkit

Firmware rootkit (BIOS-level)

Bootkit (modifies bootloader)
